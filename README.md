# Meals-app

### The following requirements must be met:

- Display of recipes.
- Display of a single recipe.
- Recipes filtering by category.
- Pagination.
  An example of pagination is below. The arrows change the page to `1`. If there are more than `10` pages, display pages `1` to `7`, then `...`, then the last page.
- Debounced search.
- Several recipes select and count the ingredients needed to prepare them. You need to display basic information about the selected recipes and combine their ingredients into one list.
- About search, category filtering, and pagination: search should be implemented through the API, while category filtering and pagination should be implemented only on the front-end.

### An example of the data obtained:

```jsx

Add the chicken and fry for 7-10 mins until cooked through and the onions have turned golden. Grate over the ginger, stir through the harissa to coat everything and cook for 1 min more.\r\n\r\nTip in the apricots, chickpeas and couscous, then pour over the stock and stir once. Cover with a lid or tightly cover the pan with foil and leave for about 5 mins until the couscous has soaked up all the stock and is soft. Fluff up the couscous with a fork and scatter over the coriander to serve. Serve with extra harissa, if you like.",

### Use the following technologies:

- [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun) as `API`.
- `React`.
- `TypeScript`.
- other auxiliary libraries.

### There should be three pages:

1. All recipes page (display a photo, name, category, and place of origin in the form of a card).
2. Single recipe page (display all the data we receive).
3. Favorite recipes page (something like a shopping cart - display cards of favorite recipes, a summary list of their ingredients, and cooking instructions).

### Additionally:

1. Use `Tanstack Query`.
2. Use cached data from `Tanstack Query` instead of `state manager`.

### Notes:

1. The test task must be placed on one of the following services: `GitHub`, `GitLab`, `BitBucket`, and it must be publicly available.
2. The test task must be registered on one of the following services: `Vercel`, `Netlify`, `Heroku`, `GitHub Pages`.
3. We expect you to come up with creative solutions to problems, such as _“How do I get all the products?”_ Good luck!
